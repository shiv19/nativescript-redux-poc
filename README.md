# Redux demo with NativeScript + JavaScript Project

This project shows how you can use Redux with plain JavaScript {N} (or even with TS)

Additional info coming soon.

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/vakrilov/ngrx-devtools-nativescript.git ./reduxDemo`

Goto `app/state/store.js` and change the hostname to your computer’s local IP address (assuming you’ll connect to a android/ios device over USB debugging) \
once the app is installed in your app,

you can run `npm run remotedev` to start the dev server\
then on a browser visit `<your ip address>:8000` to access the redux remote console console!

Now run the app using,

`tns run android` or `tns run ios`
